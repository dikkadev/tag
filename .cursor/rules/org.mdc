## Workflow expectations
1. **Initial planning**
   - When a request is non‑trivial, draft a high‑level plan first.  
   - Break work into ≤ 15 checklist items (`- [ ] task`), grouped by milestone.

2. **`.notes/` directory ownership**
   - If `.notes/` does not exist at repo root, create it.  
   - Inside `.notes/`, the agent may freely create, edit, or delete Markdown files.  
   - Keep a single `index.md` summarising active notes; move stale notes to `_archive/` or delete them.

3. **Checklists—lightweight, not bureaucratic**
   - Keep checklists current; an unchecked item older than one week signals the plan needs revisiting.  
   - Collapse or remove completed lists instead of keeping pages of obsolete ticks.

4. **Web scouting before implementation**
   - For every major library, framework, or API decision, perform a quick web lookup:  
     1. Retrieve latest stable version and ecosystem health.  
     2. Note any breaking‑change alerts.  
   - Summarise findings in the relevant note before writing code.

5. **Continuous note hygiene**
   - At the end of each agent session:  
     - Mark completed tasks with `- [x]`.  
     - Remove or archive files that are no longer accurate.  
     - Update `index.md` with the current status snapshot.

6. **Etiquette**
   - Prefer concise, actionable prose.  
   - Avoid duplicating information already available in code comments or READMEs.
